# AI-Maze-Solver
This project contains the implementation of various search techniques, including DFS, BFS, A* Search, and MDP algorithms (Value Iteration and Policy Iteration) for solving a maze. The repository aims to compare the performance of these techniques in terms of finding the shortest path in the maze.
